## 2. Open in KiCAD. [[toc](https://github.com/AntoineStevan/uComputer-power-supply/tree/main/#table-of-content)]
This project has been designed under KiCAD, which is, according to their official website, *an open-source software tool for the creation of electronic schematic diagrams and PCB artwork.*  
All usefull official documentation can be found on the website of the Kicad software [here](https://www.kicad.org/).  
Furthermore, parts have been ordered by [Mouser](https://www.mouser.fr/) and PCBs have been manufactured by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).

### 2.1. Install KiCAD. [[toc](https://github.com/AntoineStevan/uComputer-power-supply/tree/main/#table-of-content)]
Official KiCAD material can be found [here](https://docs.kicad.org/5.1/en/getting_started_in_kicad/getting_started_in_kicad.html).  
Further specific material for Linux users can be found [here](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/kicad).

### 2.2. Use KiCAD. [[toc](https://github.com/AntoineStevan/uComputer-power-supply/tree/main/#table-of-content)]
The KiCAD team provides plenty of documentation and examples on their official website [here](https://docs.kicad.org/).  
The Internet is also full of great quality tutorials on many topics concerning KiCAD software and schematics/PCB design in general.
